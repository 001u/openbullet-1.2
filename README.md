# OpenBullet
The OpenBullet web testing application.

# How to compile
1. Clone the [official Extreme.Net repository](https://github.com/nickolasKrayn/Extreme.Net).
2. Compile it and obtain the Extreme.Net.dll file.
3. Clone this repository and open it in Visual Studio.
4. Wait until Visual Studio fetches all the required nuget packages.
5. Right click on each of the 3 projects and from the menu select Add > Reference.
6. Add the previously compiled Extreme.Net.dll file and click OK.
7. Switch to Release mode for a much cleaner output.
8. Compile the solution.
9. You can find the compiled projects under OpenBullet/bin/Release and OpenBulletCLI/bin/Release.

# Credits
I want to thank all the community for their inputs that shaped OpenBullet into what it is now, and my gratitude goes to the two people who for the past couple of months helped me test and debug the build: **demiurgo** and **meinname**.
